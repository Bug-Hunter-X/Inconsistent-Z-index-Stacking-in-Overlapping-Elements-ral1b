# Inconsistent Z-index Stacking in Overlapping CSS Elements

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue in CSS: inconsistent z-index stacking order across different browsers.  While the `z-index` property is intended to control the stacking context of elements, the actual rendering can be affected by factors such as the order in which elements appear in the HTML and the browser's rendering engine.

The `inconsistentZindex.css` file contains CSS code that reproduces the problem.  The `fixedZindex.css` file provides a solution to ensure consistent stacking order.

## Problem

The problem lies in the unpredictable stacking of elements with different `z-index` values.  Even when a clear stacking order should be defined, different browsers might render the elements differently, leading to unexpected visual results.

## Solution

The solution in `fixedZindex.css` involves ensuring that elements are placed within clearly defined stacking contexts to avoid conflicts. In some cases you may need to refactor the HTML and CSS to enforce a correct rendering order. Consider using flexbox or grid to control layout for greater predicability.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (you may need to create a basic HTML file to test the CSS) in different browsers.
3. Observe the different rendering behavior of the overlapping elements.
