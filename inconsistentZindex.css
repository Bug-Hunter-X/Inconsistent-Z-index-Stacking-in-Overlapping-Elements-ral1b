The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of overlapping elements with different z-index values is not consistent across different browsers.  This is particularly problematic when dealing with complex layouts or animations.  The element with the higher z-index should always be on top, however inconsistent z-index stacking can be observed due to factors like rendering order.

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  position: relative;
}

.element1 {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 50px;
  z-index: 1;
}

.element2 {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  z-index: 2;
}
```
